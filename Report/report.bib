  Abstract                 = {The growing number of blogs, forums and social networks
in the Web drastically increased the amount of texts conveying not just
facts but opinions. A large number of opinions are customers’ reviews
about products and services, as e-commerce became more popular. This
trend motivated several research works and market applications aiming
at the automatic analysis of the available opinions. Clearly, this information
is crucial for managers, who should improve the quality of the
offered services based on customers’ opinions. Concerning services provided
by enterprises such as stores or hotels, it is particularly difficult
to identify the features being commented on (e.g., quality of service, delivery
cost, etc). This work presents a domain-free process for feature
extraction which was used in the construction of WhatMatter. The prototype
system was used for feature extraction from opinions on services
(a domain not yet covered by the literature). The obtained results were
very satisfactory.},
