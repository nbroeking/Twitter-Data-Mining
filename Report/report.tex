\begin{abstract}
With social media on the rise, the amount of data available for processing is
growing at an increasing rate. It is an advanced area of research to be able to
use that data to predict or better understand the world around us. In our
project we will attempt to use Twitter to determine if, and how strong of, a
relationship exists between public sentiment and chosen stock values.

\section*{Goal}

To determine if there is a relationship between the sentiment of tweets and the
change in stock price for the next day. Then to create a user friendly mobile
application to display real time stock predictions.

\section{Introduction}

The recent rise in popularity of online social media has led to a huge amount
of social data available online for analysis. The popular social media site,
Twitter, gets an average of 6,000 tweets posted per second and 500 million per
day. These tweets can be analyzed to determine future market values. For the
purposes of this project we looked at four companies, Amazon, Apple, Google,
and Samsung.o  

The first step is to open a connection to the twitter streaming api. Using this
api we receive anywhere between 1\% and 40\% of all the tweets being tweeted.
This percentage depends on the current Twitter load. We collect the stock
information from yahoo finance. We store the stock data for the same time
period we get the stock data for multiple granularities.

The next phase in our pipeline is the data storage step. We are using sqlite3 as
a data warehouse to store all of our tweets. Each tweet stores information
related to the user and the tweet to determine possible variables to match
against for the statistical analysis.

The third phase is to pre-process the data. Before we process the data we need
to filter based on language. We only accept tweets that are English and have no
images or videos. Once we have our English tweets we start categorizing the
tweets. We separate each tweet into four different bins, one for each company.
We then change all URLs to URL and all hash tags to TAG. This allows us to use
these as features for the sentiment analysis. 

The fourth phase is our sentiment analysis phase. We use a naive Bayesian
classifier to detect whether a tweet is positive. Once we have applyed our
sentiment analysis to the data send it to our next stage.

We are currently working to implement this phase. We are taking the data and
trying to detemine a relationship between the sentiment and a change in the
stock price.

Our next step is to determine the realtionship between the variables and then implemnt a mobile application
that recomends which company to invest in. 

\section{Authors}

The authors of this proposal are Nicolas Broeking, Anna
Hoffee, and Joshua Rahm. Broeking and Rahm are graduate students at the
University of Colorado at Boulder. Hoffee is a undergraduate student at the
University of Colorado. Nicolas Broeking has worked on embedded systems and
mobile applications for the past four years. He would like to take the results
from the project and create a user friendly application that allows a user to
easily interact with the data and make financial predictions.  Josh Rahm has
spent his career working with embedded devices, cellular technologies and
billing platforms, and is interested in applying data mining concepts to
markets.  

\section{Motivation}

The Stock Market is one of the largest entities in Western
and World economies. In a world where a 15\% increase is assets per year is
massive,  even the ability to increase certainty in the market by a few percent
is a huge. Companies and individuals can harness this technology make billions
and secure investments, producing and saving billions for the economy. While
making billions is outside the scope of this project, we think it is possible
to significantly increase the accuracy of stock predictions. We know that
public image is critical to stock value. If a company's image drastically
decreases then we know that its stock value will change. It is our goal to
discover how the company's public image, determined through Twitter, will
affect its stock price.  

\section{Literature Survey}

Many similar experiments have been done in the
field of data mining. The first and probably the closest to our project is
Correlating Financial Time Series with Micro-Blogging. This project looks at
150 random companies stock prices over a six month time period. Then they take
all the tweets with specific hashtags related to the company and construct a
context graph. In this graph the tweets themselves were nodes and any actions
on the tweets were edges. They then use this graph to find relationships with
the stock price. This project looked for other things than just stock trends
though. They wanted to find relationships between the data and how much a stock
will change, and what the values of the stock will be. They determined that the
most reliable way to determine the information is by looking at the number of
edges in the graph.[1] 

Another team, Twitter Mood Predicts the Stock Market, attempted to determine
how twitter “mood” effects the stock price. They grouped tweets into 6
dimensions Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy. They then took these
categories and created a relationship between to the closing value of the Dow
Jones. They found that there is a correlation between what people are posting
and how the stock market as a whole performs. [2] 

Many other studies have been done similar to the first two on how to use
twitter to predict stock prices. The one thing that has been determined for
sure is that there is a high correlation between peoples' attitudes and stock
value. Twitter was used in 2013 to predict a drop in Royal Caribbean's stock
value when people started tweeting about the flu spreading on one of its
cruises. Researchers were able to predict the drop in price 48 minutes before
the stock plunged about 3%.[3]

\section{Tasks}
In order to achive this task we split our project up into 7 tasks.

\subsection{Data Collection} 
\subsubsection{Stock Collection} 

Yahoo Finances allows us to gather historical stock data for each of the four
companies.  This data source provides us with the Open, Close, High, Low, and
Data attributes. We use this information to find a correlation between the
sentiment of the tweets and the change in stock price.

\subsubsection{Twitter Collection} 

Twitter data is collected from the Twitter Streaming api. This api provides us
anywhere from 4\% to 40\% of all tweets being posted depending on the current
load that twitter has to handle. These tweets are stored in a sqlite3 database.
For each tweet we store:  if the tweet was re-tweeted, how many times the tweet
was re-tweeted, the date and time, the user id, the tweet id, the users
followers count, the users friend count, the user's name and finally the tweets
text..

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

In the preprocessing step we need to filter our tweets on certain criteria. The
first thing we do is filter all tweets based off of if they contain a reference
to one of the four companies. For simplicity if a tweet contains any of the
words, Apple, Google, Samsung, or Amazon we store it. The next step is to
filter based off of language. Because analyzing tweets in multiple languages
makes the problem very difficult we only store english tweets. The final step
in pre processing the data is to change all URLs in the tweet to URL and to
change all hashtags to TAG. This allows us to create a feature that we can use
to do sentiment analysis in the next step.

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}

Once we have preprocessed all of the tweets we can finally analyze the text
segment. To perform sentiment analysis we use a naive Bayes classifier. We
train the classifier on 5000 tweets and then test its accuracy with 10000
tweets.  We are only interested in the ratio between positive tweets to total
tweets so we trained our classifier to mark anything that was not obviously
positive as negative. We did not need to include a neutral category. 

Performing sentiment analysis on tweets proved to be a much harder task than
initially thought. We experimented with using different features such as
letters, user attributes, and tweet attributes but for the most part these led
to very low accuracies. Finally we found that taking the 50 most positive words
from that training set and using these as features for the classifier yielded
the highest accuracy. 

The accuracy of our classifier is about 64\%. We were
not initially satisfied with this accuracy however in our research to create a
better twitter sentiment engine we talked with Jamey Wood, CTO of Wayin. Wayin
specializes in twitter sentiment analysis. 64\% is acctually a very high
accuracy for this kind of analysis in industry and so increasing the accuracy
much higher seems to be an impossible task.

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}

After we have our classified text we pass
